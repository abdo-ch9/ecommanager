# Quick Fix for Shopify Integration

## Problem
The form gets stuck when clicking "Connect" - likely due to API endpoint issues.

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Test the Debug Page
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/debug`
2. Fill in test data:
   - Store Domain: `test-store`
   - API Key: `test-key`
   - Password: `test-password`
3. Click "Test Basic API" - this should work
4. Click "Test Shopify Simple" - this should also work

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open the main integration page
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Try connecting Shopify
5. Look for any error messages

### Step 3: Temporary Workaround
If the API calls are failing, you can temporarily bypass the API call by:

1. In the integration page, replace the API call with a mock response
2. This will let you test the UI flow without the API

## Expected Results

### If Debug Page Works:
- The API endpoints are functional
- The issue is in the main integration page logic

### If Debug Page Fails:
- There's a fundamental issue with API routing or dependencies
- Check Next.js server console for errors

### If Browser Console Shows Errors:
- JavaScript errors preventing the function from completing
- Network errors preventing API calls

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Failed to fetch" Error
- API endpoint doesn't exist or has syntax errors
- Check `/app/api/shopify/test-connection/route.js`

### 2. "Session not found" Error
- User not logged in
- Supabase auth not working

### 3. Network timeout
- API call taking too long
- Shopify API credentials invalid

### 4. Database errors
- Supabase connection issues
- Missing tables or permissions

## Next Steps

1. Test the debug page first
2. Report what you see in the browser console
3. Check the Next.js server console for errors
4. We can then apply the appropriate fix

The debug page will help isolate whether the issue is:
- Frontend JavaScript
- API routing
- Database connection
- External API calls
